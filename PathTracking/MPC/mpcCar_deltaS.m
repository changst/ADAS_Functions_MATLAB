% %% Specify Mixed I/O Constraints for Obstacle Avoidance Maneuver
% % There are different strategies to make the ego car avoid an obstacle on
% % the road. For example, a real-time path planner can compute a new path
% % after an obstacle is detected and the controller follows this path.
% %
% % In this example, use a different approach that takes advantage of the
% % ability of MPC to handle constraints explicitly. When an obstacle is
% % detected, it defines an area on the road (in terms of constraints) that
% % the ego car must not enter during the prediction horizon. At the next
% % control interval, the area is redefined based on the new positions of
% % the ego car and obstacle until passing is completed.
% %
% % To define the area to avoid, use the following mixed input/output
% % constraints:
% %
% %   E*u + F*y <= G
% % 
% % where |u| is the manipulated variable vector and |y| is the output
% % variable vector. You can update the constraint matrices |E|, |F|, and |G|
% % when the controller is running.
% 
% %%
% % The first constraint is an upper bound on $y$ ($y \le 6$ on this
% % three-lane road).
% E1 = [0 0];
% F1 = [0 1 0 0]; 
% G1 = laneWidth*lanes/2;
% 
% %%
% % The second constraint is a lower bound on $y$ ($y \ge -6$ on this
% % three-lane road).
% E2 = [0 0];
% F2 = [0 -1 0 0]; 
% G2 = laneWidth*lanes/2;
% 
% %%
% % The third constraint is for obstacle avoidance. Even though no obstacle
% % is detected at the nominal operating condition, you must add a "fake"
% % constraint here because you cannot change the dimensions of the
% % constraint matrices at run time. For the fake constraint, use a
% % constraint with the same form as the second constraint.
% E3 = [0 0];
% F3 = [0 -1 0 0]; 
% G3 = laneWidth*lanes/2;
% 
% %%
% % Specify the mixed input/output constraints in the controller using the
% % |setconstraint| function.
% setconstraint(mpcobj,[E1;E2;E3],[F1;F2;F3],[G1;G2;G3],[1;1;0.1]);

%% Simulate Controller
% In this example, you use an adaptive MPC controller because it handles
% the nonlinear vehicle dynamics more effectively than a traditional MPC
% controller. A traditional MPC controller uses a constant plant model.
% However, adaptive MPC allows you to provide a new plant model at each
% control interval. Because the new model describes the plant dynamics more
% accurately at the new operating condition, an adaptive MPC controller
% performs better than a traditional MPC controller.
%
% Also, to enable the controller to avoid the safe zone surrounding the
% obstacle, you update the third mixed constraint at each control interval.
% Basically, the ego car must be above the line formed from the ego car to
% the upper left corner of the safe zone. For more details, open
% |obstacleComputeCustomConstraint|.
